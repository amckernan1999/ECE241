Summary: This is the final project and utilizes an encoder button, 4x20 LCD matrix, and arduino nano. This project contains two games, minesweeper and one similar to
asteroids to be played on a a portable device. It utilizes EEPROM to save high scores, and a button encoder for controls and menuing. I worked on the menuing, hi-scores, 
display and minesweeper game.
